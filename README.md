# Use of ARIMA Model in prediction and Forecasting
ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) is a statistical model used for time series analysis and forecasting. It is a popular approach for analyzing and predicting data that exhibits a temporal dependency or trend over time. The ARIMA model combines three key components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA).

Autoregression (AR): This component models the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations. It assumes that the value of a variable at a given time point depends on its previous values. The "p" parameter in ARIMA denotes the number of lagged observations used in the model.

Differencing (I): Time series data often exhibit trends or seasonality that can make forecasting challenging. The differencing component helps remove these trends by subtracting the previous observation from the current observation. The differencing parameter "d" represents the order of differencing applied to the data.

Moving Average (MA): This component models the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. The "q" parameter in ARIMA represents the number of lagged residuals used in the model.
